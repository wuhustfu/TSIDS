#This is the work for "TSIDS: Spatial-temporal Fusion gating Multilayer Perceptron for Network Intrusion Detection"

First, run temporal.py to obtain the temporal features by BiLSTM.

Then, run fusion_cgMLP.py to obtain spatial features and fuse the temporal and spatial features, and gMLP will process this fusion feature to do the classification 
work.


Likewise, if there is any question, contact me whufu@whu.edu.cn. Thanks.
