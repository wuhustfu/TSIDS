#This is the work for "TSIDS: Spatial-temporal Fusion gating Multilayer Perceptron for Network Intrusion Detection"

First, run temporal.py is to obtain the temporal features by BiLSTM.
Then, fusion_cgMLP.py is to fuse the temporal and temporal features, and this fusion feature will be processed by gMLP to do the classification 
work.


Likewise, if there is any question, contact me whufu@whu.edu.cn. Thanks.
